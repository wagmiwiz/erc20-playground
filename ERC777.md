ERC-777 is a token standard that improves on ERC-20.

The main motivations are:

- It introduced the concept of "operators" that can send tokens on behalf of other addresses.

- It introduced hooks that allow contracts and regular addresses to react to receiving tokens, enabling more complex interactions. This allows combining of approval and transfer steps into a single transaction, potentially saving gas costs (amongst other things).

- It is fully compatible with ERC-20

Despite this ERC-777 hasn't seen widespread adoption due to potential security concerns with improper usage and the established dominance of ERC-20.
